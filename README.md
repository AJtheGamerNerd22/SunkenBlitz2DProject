# SunkenBlitz2DProject
Place for my (currently) unfinished 2D Unity game project for my college class.

Unfortunately, due to heavy workload from my other classes this semester, I have been unable to dedicate enough time to develop a complete version of this game. However, I tried to include as much of the core concepts of what was supposed to be included based on the one-pager I initially wrote. Despite the current state of the game, I hope that the person evaluating this project is somewhat intrigued by what I could create.

Includes:
- Small avatar representing the player as a diver
- WASD controls for swimming around the map
- Dashing mechanic (Press "Space")
- Background music
- Audio
